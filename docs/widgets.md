# Widgets

Editor widgets allow for a more fine-grained configuration of the toolbar and sidebar behaviour.
Both the toolbar and sidebar may be configured through widgets, some of which become available through the configuration of certain editor plugins.

Custom toolbar and sidebar options may be configured while initializing the editor through the `toolbar` and `sidebar` configurations.
If no such configurations are provided, a default toolbar and sidebar will be shown, in part based on the configured editor plugins.

More information on how to configure an editor toolbar or sidebar may be found in the following documents:

- [toolbar](/docs/widgets/toolbar.md)
- [sidebar](/docs/widgets/sidebar.md)
