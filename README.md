# frontend-embeddable-notule-editor

This application allows you to embed the RDFa editor in other applications without integrating with EmberJS directly. It will behave like any other HTML editor.

## Target usage

The idea is that you can have multiple HTML tags in which you can initialize an editor. We'll explain how it works and the process can be repeated if multiple editors are required. We need some HTML structure to start with, and then set-up the editor when everything has finished loading and rendering. We can also initialize the editor with some content or set it later via an event. Use something like the following HTML snippet as a base. *Note that the order of the JavaScript files matters.*

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>I have an editor in my document</title>

    <!-- Requirements for the style -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/frontend-embeddable-notule-editor.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/vendor.css">

    <!-- Sources of the editor, THE ORDER MATTERS -->
    <script src="assets/vendor.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/frontend-embeddable-notule-editor-app.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/frontend-embeddable-notule-editor.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

Next, put some tags in the body of the page. We'll place the editor in those tags.

```html
<body>
  <div id="my-editor"></div>
</body>
```

Lastly, we'll instantiate the editor. We wait until the DOM has loaded and then initialize the embedded EmberJS app with the editor inside. Put this script in the head of the HTML page with `<script>...</script>`, or use another method if desired (e.g. at the bottom of the HTML).

```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', function () {
  let App = require('frontend-embeddable-notule-editor/app').default.create({
    autoboot: false,
    name: 'frontend-embeddable-notule-editor'
  });
  App.visit('/', { rootElement: '#my-editor' }).then(() => {
    const editorContainer = document.getElementById('my-editor');
    const editorElement =
    editorContainer.getElementsByClassName('notule-editor')[0];
    console.log(editorElement);
    const arrayOfPluginNames = ['citation', 'rdfa-date'];
    const userConfigObject = {}
    editorElement.initEditor(arrayOfPluginNames, userConfigObject);;
  });
```

Once the editor is initialized, you can get the relevant document node and set its content. You can play with this by opening the developer console and executing the following, or use the following code in another script:

```javascript
const editorContainer = document.getElementById('my-editor');
const editorElement = editorContainer.getElementsByClassName('notule-editor')[0]
editorElement.setHtmlContent('<h1>Hello World</h1>');  // note: the content in the page changes
console.log(editorElement.getHtmlContent());           // note: there may be a difference in returned content
```

The contents may be slightly different between the two modes. As the editor evolves, the exporting functionality will be able to better filter out the relevant HTML and remove temporary styling.


You can enable/disable an environment banner using the following methods:
```javascript
editorElement.enableEnvironmentBanner('Testing');
editorElement.enableEnvironmentBanner(); // the default environment name is 'Test'
editorElement.disableEnvironmentBanner();
```

For a complete version of this example, checkout this file: [public/test.html](public/test.html). It also includes another button that inserts a template in the editor to showcase the plugins.

## Building the sources

In order to build the JavaScript and CSS sources of this repository you will need `ember-cli` installed (more info at section *Development of frontend-embeddable-notule-editor* below), then execute the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lblod/frontend-embeddable-notule-editor.git
cd frontend-embeddable-notule-editor
npm install
ember build -prod
```

In the 'dist' folder structure, two CSS files and three JavaScript files will have been generated. These are the files to use, as demonstrated in the example above. Note that the fingerprints of your files may vary.

```bash
dist
└── assets
    ├── frontend-embeddable-notule-editor-app.js
    ├── frontend-embeddable-notule-editor.css
    ├── frontend-embeddable-notule-editor.js
    ├── vendor.css
    └── vendor.js
```

## Configuring the editor

The editor can be customized to best fit your application. In order to use the editor with these options, be sure to rebuild the sources.

### Adding/removing plugins
Embeddable ships with the following plugins available, for more info on each of them and posible configurations, check the documentation of [lblod/ember-rdfa-editor-lblod-plugins](https://github.com/lblod/ember-rdfa-editor-lblod-plugins):
* `besluit`: mostly provides the correct nodes for constructing a besluit, it's mostly useful for validation in prosemirror internals
* `citation`: recognizes citations and allows inserting an annotation manually
* `rdfa-date`: allow inserting and modifying annoted date and times
* `roadsign-regulation`: allow inserting roadsign regulation, based on the registry managed and provided by MOW.
* `template-variable`: Related to the roadsign-regulation plugin, allows filling in variables in the road sign regulation templates.
* `variable`: Allows insertion of custom variables to be later filled by the template-variable plugin
* `article-structure`: Provides several structures to better manage official documents, like titles, chapters, articles and paragraphs. Allows you to insert, move and delete them in an easy way
* `table-of-contents`: Provides a table of contents that allow you to click on it to go to the different sections specified with the article-structure plugin

See above for how these plugins can be enabled.
ATTENTION: Currently the besluit node is incompatible with the article-structure node, so you can only have one active at the moment

### Default configuration
We provide the following defaults in case you enable a plugin and don't provide any configuration to it, you can take it as a base for your desired configuration. Take into account that if you provide any configuration to a plugin all of the default will be overrided, so make sure you include all the relevant attributes.

```
{
  docContent: 'table_of_contents? ((chapter|block)+|(title|block)+)',
  date: {
    placeholder: {
      insertDate: this.intl.t('date-plugin.insert.date'),
      insertDateTime: this.intl.t('date-plugin.insert.datetime'),
    },
    formats: [
      {
        label: 'Short Date',
        key: 'short',
        dateFormat: 'dd/MM/yy',
        dateTimeFormat: 'dd/MM/yy HH:mm',
      },
      {
        label: 'Long Date',
        key: 'long',
        dateFormat: 'EEEE dd MMMM yyyy',
        dateTimeFormat: 'PPPPp',
      },
    ],
    allowCustomFormat: true,
  },
  citation: {
    type: 'ranges',
    activeInRanges: (state) => [[0, state.doc.content.size]],
  },
  variable: {
    type: 'ranges',
    activeInRanges: (state) => [[0, state.doc.content.size]],
  },
  tableOfContents: [
    {
      nodeHierarchy: [
        'title|chapter|section|subsection|article',
        'structure_header|article_header',
      ],
    },
  ],
  articleStructure: {
    mode: 'regulatoryStatement',
  }
}
```

### Enabling/disabling the environment banner
The environment banner is a visual indication of the environment you are currently using and which versions of embeddable, the editor and editor-plugins are in use.

You can enable/disable the banner using the following methods: `enableEnvironmentBanner` and `disableEnvironmentBanner`.

### Localization

Localization of the editor is an ongoing effort, the main target usage of embeddable is currently Dutch speaking users. Some plugins, like the [citation plugin](https://github.com/lblod/ember-rdfa-editor-citaten-plugin/), use date pickers. The display format of these dates can be configured in the localization initializer.

### Styling

Styling the editor is covered in the [README](https://github.com/lblod/ember-rdfa-editor#customisation) of ember-rdfa-editor. This frontend supports SASS, customizations can be added to [app.scss](app/styles/app.scss)

**The following section is automatically generated. It can provide usefull information on how to get started on development on this editor and with EmberJS.**
